# Alarm-Smart-Bulb

In this project, I want to design an alarm system that uses a light bulb to wake up the user. The system has three main functions: turning the light on and off with a push button, setting an alarm timer, and automatically waking the user by turning on the light directly into their eyes at the scheduled time.

I built my system with: 

1. Hardware include:
- ESP32 Wrom32 Devkit
- Relay module is trigger with high mode
- Bulb (220VAC)
- Wire
2. Software include:
- UI with pyqt5
- HTTP
- Flutter App Controlling
3. Schematic
